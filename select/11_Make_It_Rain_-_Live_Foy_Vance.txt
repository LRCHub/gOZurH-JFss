When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
Even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
And, Lord, just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
And the seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hotter
And the hunger more profound
Well, I know there can come tears from their eyes
But they may as well be in vain
Even though
I know these tears will bring me pain
Even so
And, Lord, just the same
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
The seas fill with water
Stops by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
Never reach the port
Let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
Oh, let lightning be the veins
Fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When it's time
To make a change
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, Lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down
Make it rain
Make it rain
